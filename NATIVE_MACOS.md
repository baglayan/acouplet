# Development

Use Xcode 27.0 with the macOS 27.0 SDK. The deployment target is macOS 15.4.
The native HUD is checked at launch and falls back when unavailable.
Select Xcode under Xcode > Settings > Locations > Command Line Tools before
running the commands below.

## Build

Fetch the build dependency, then open `Acouplet.xcodeproj`:

```sh
Packaging/fetch-sparkle.sh
open Acouplet.xcodeproj
```

Select your development team under Signing & Capabilities and run the Acouplet
scheme. Debug uses a separate bundle identifier from the installed app.

To build a local installer using an existing Apple Development certificate:

```sh
DEVELOPER_DIR="$(xcode-select -p)" Packaging/package.sh --local
```

Quit the installed app, then open `Install.command` in
`.build/local-update/Acouplet/`. See that package's README for removal instructions.
Do not rebuild while installation is running.

## Artwork and build options

The default build uses the repository's vector artwork. Product photographs
are optional and are not included in the repository. To use an external catalog:

```sh
DEVELOPER_DIR="$(xcode-select -p)" \
ACOUPLET_SONY_ARTWORK_DIR=/path/to/SonyPhotos.xcassets Packaging/package.sh --local
```

For builds in Xcode, set `ACOUPLET_NO_SONY_ARTWORK=NO` and
`ACOUPLET_SONY_ARTWORK_DIR` to that catalog. It is combined with the vectors in
DerivedData; the source tree is unchanged.

`ACOUPLET_PUBLIC_APIS_ONLY=YES` excludes private system integrations and LDAC.

## Tests

```sh
Packaging/fetch-sparkle.sh
python3 Packaging/check-all.py
```

This runs XCTest, offline native helper and driver checks, localization checks,
and packaging fixtures. It stops at the first failure. `Packaging/direct.sh`
runs the same checks before packaging a production release.

UI tests, native HUD presentation and the launch service check run separately.
Bluetooth, audio and connection recovery still need testing with real hardware.
